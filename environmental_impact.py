    Environmental Impact Report for Fast Fashion Industry (2025)

    1. Carbon Emissions: {carbon_emissions:.2f} kg CO2e
    2. Water Consumption: {water_consumption:.2f} liters
    3. Textile Waste: {textile_waste:.2f} tons
    4. Microplastic Pollution: {microplastic_pollution:.2f} tons

    The fast fashion industry continues to have a significant environmental impact:
    - It accounts for 10% of global carbon emissions, surpassing international flights and maritime shipping combined.
    - The industry uses 141 billion cubic meters of water annually.
    - Fast fashion contributes to 35% of microplastics polluting our oceans.
    - Up to 8,000 different chemicals are used in textile production.

    Market Growth:
    - The fast fashion market size has grown to $150.82 billion in 2025.
    - It is projected to reach $291.1 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 10.7% from 2024 to 2032.

    Recommendations:
    1. Transition to sustainable materials and production methods.
    2. Implement circular economy practices to reduce waste.
    3. Invest in water-saving technologies and processes.
    4. Develop innovative solutions to address microplastic pollution.
    5. Educate consumers about the environmental impact of fast fashion.
