    Environmental Impact Report for Fast Fashion Industry (2025)

    1. Carbon Emissions: {carbon_emissions:.2f} tons CO2e
    2. Water Consumption: {water_consumption:.2f} cubic meters
    3. Textile Waste: {textile_waste:.2f} tons
    4. Microplastic Pollution: {microplastic_pollution:.2f} tons
    5. Chemical Usage: {chemical_usage:.2f} kg

    Key Findings:
    - The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions, surpassing international flights and maritime shipping combined[1][3][5].
    - The industry uses 141 billion cubic meters of water annually[3].
    - Fast fashion contributes to 35% of microplastics polluting our oceans[3].
    - Up to 8,000 different chemicals are used in textile production[5].
    - One polyester blouse generates 11.6 kg CO2e from production to retail[5].
    - 20% of global water pollution comes from textile dyeing[5].
    - Synthetic materials release 500,000 tons of microfibers into the oceans annually[5].

    Market Growth:
    - The fast fashion market size has grown to $163.21 billion in 2025[2].
    - It is projected to reach $214.24 billion by 2029, growing at a CAGR of 7%[2].

    Recommendations:
    1. Transition to sustainable materials and production methods.
    2. Implement circular economy practices to reduce waste.
    3. Invest in water-saving technologies and processes.
    4. Develop innovative solutions to address microplastic pollution.
    5. Educate consumers about the environmental impact of fast fashion.
