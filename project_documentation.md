## 11. Environmental Impact of Fast Fashion (2025)
- Carbon Emissions: The fashion industry is responsible for 10% of global carbon emissions, more than international flights and maritime shipping combined[1][3][5].
- Textile Waste: Consumers produce 92 million tonnes of textile waste yearly, projected to reach 134 million tonnes by 2030[1][5].
- Water Consumption: The fashion industry uses 141 billion cubic meters of water annually[3].
- Microplastic Pollution: The industry contributes to 35% of microplastics polluting oceans[3].
- Chemical Usage: Up to 8,000 different chemicals are used to transform raw materials into textiles[5].
- Polyester Production: One polyester blouse generates 11.6 kg CO2e from production to retail[5].

## 12. Market Growth Projections
- The fast fashion market size is estimated at $150.82 billion in 2025[3].
- The market is projected to reach $291.1 billion by 2032, growing at a CAGR of 10.7% from 2024 to 2032[3].
